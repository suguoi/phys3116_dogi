## agenda + notes
- new version of main thats cleaner

- added id to the clusters in the position/velocity plot
- added the eqn of the trendline in the age/metallicity plot
- just realised that rg vs escape velocity is probably not we want
- added a plot of rg vs radial velocity instead, this time there is a visible pattern
- added a colourbar to the 3d xyz plot of the radial velocities
- that one cluster away from the bulge with high vr looks sus
- look for clusters that look diff to its neighbours

- only combine harris1 and harris 3 data when plotting cos they have matching clusters, dont combine with krause and vanderberg

- add labels to the clusters in the 3d plots
- add a working plot of cluster mass vs dispersion velocity
- label too

- maybe a plot of rh vs mstar from krause as well to see which ones are compact and not
- compact clusters more resistant to stripping
- not compact mightve been stripped by milky way
