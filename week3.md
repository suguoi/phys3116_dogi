# Meeting Notes
## thursday 2nd october
## People present
- andrew 
- anthony 
- susan

## we were having issues committing
## i think its because we were all trying to commit something at the same time during the meeting
## i overrode the remote branch with my local one which hopefully fixes the issue
## but it seems like we lost the previous timeline where it shows the work that everyone had contributed
## woops sorry
## oh it still shows up online all good but im gonna leave this here just in case

## agenda + notes
- using info that is necessary for metallicity/age plot
- x axis- age
- y axis- metallicity
- the idea is that accreted clusters have diff trends to the milky way og clusters since they are formed in different environments aka diff metal compositions
- younger fellas are more processed so more metals (probs the imposters)

- velocity vs position plot
- milky way has clusters that follow a predictable pattern
- accreted will have weird motions so those are probs the imposters

- dispersion velocity vs mass
- too high, stars are moving faster than expected for its mass
- when movement is weird for its mass, probably not from milky way
