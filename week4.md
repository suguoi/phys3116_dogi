## Meeting Notes
## thursday 9nd october
## People present
- Andrew 
- Anthony 
- Susan

## agenda + notes
- we have the plot of the spatial coordinates and the metallicity but these are separate, we will try and combine them so we can see the relationships
- use the x-y-z 3d plot we have and do the colour thing so we can see the metallicity with each point cool
- anthony can do this since his plot from week 3 dont work

- susan - metalicity/age relation from last week
- label each point so we can see which specific luster might be an outlier
- researched a young and old cluster that belongs to the milky way and plot a line through them
- i think the metallicty/age relation is !ROUGHLY! linear so i just plot a line through them and maybe thats a trendline
- i must say it looks stupid

- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.0822
- nice source
- needa ask if im allowed to use O_O

- andrew- velocity vs position
- label each point too
- see if theres a trendline 
- nevermind theres no trendline
- found a better method of fitting a trendline to the metallicity/age plot
